# Jetox

The most [unnecessarily powerful](/markryall/jetox/blob/master/media/jetox.mp3?raw=true) hand dryer ever manufactured.

It turns out that the product this gem is based on is actually called _JetOz_ but since that is a boring name, we'll stick to what we _thought_ it was called.

## Store

You can purchase jetox related merchandise [here](https://redbubble.com/shop/jetox)

## Usage

It's so simple!

`gem install jetox`

Then when life gets you down:

`jetox`

_or_ in your ruby library:

```
require 'jetox'

Jetox.engage
```
